 * Method to handle writing ('encoding') a WEBP file.
 *
 * So there's a lot of potential options here.  At first, I was going to
 * use the dialog box approach used by PNG, JPEG, TIFF and some others to
 * offer these options.
 *
 * However, the amount of work involved there -- and believe me, I know,
 * I went pretty far down the rabbit hole -- is a magnitude more than
 * doing it the easy way.  Not only is the XV UI side much more complex,
 * but to expose the options is way more complex on the libwebp side as
 * well.  It goes from a single well-documented function call, to a bunch
 * of not well documented function calls and a need to write callbacks and
 * such.
 *
 * I came to realize that I, personally, am unlikely to ever save a webp
 * file and that I just don't care enough to put that level of work into
 * it.
 *
 * I'm sorry! :)
 *
 * Thus, this just saves lossless format with default settings.  I figure
 * that is the most useful webp to save.  We could make a seperate
 * webp (lossless) vs. webp (lossy) save list items and treat them like
 * 2 different formats to avoid the dialog box.  Or if someone comes along
 * later and cares to implement the dialog box, more power to you.
 *
 * xvpng.c has a very good example of how to do it, and you'll have to
 * remove this WriteWEBP call from xvdir.c and grep around for HAVE_PNG
 * in the rest of the code -- particularly xv.c, xvdir.c and xvevent.c -- to do
 * it.  It's not super hard, but it'll take this from an afternoon project
 * to a "few days" project if I do that, and that's more than I can do
 * right now.
 *
 * Sorry for writing a diary journal in comments!  But hopefully this is
 * helpful for someone else who may come along and care about this problem
 * more than I do.
